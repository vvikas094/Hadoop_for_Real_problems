##Derived statistics on Twitter data using Hadoop

1) What hour of the day does a user, &#064PrezOno tweet the most on average, using every day we have twitter data?  Include a plot of the expected number of tweets for each hour of the day, for those he did tweet.  For example if Ono tweeted once every day at 12:30PM, his expected number of tweets between 12 and 1 would be 1.  If he alternates between 2 and 3 tweets per day, his average would be 2.5.


2) What day of the week does &#064PrezOno tweet the most on average?  Use the same example as in #1 but for days of the week.


3) How does &#064PrezOnoâ€™s tweet length compare to the average of all others?  What is his average length?  All others?


4) For those tweets with location information, what lat/long (or city/state) is the centroid?  What was the proportion of tweets with location to those without?
